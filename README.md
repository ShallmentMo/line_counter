# LineCounter

## Description

At the beginning, I just want to know how many lines of code in [plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug). Then I think why not use elixir to write a tool to count that. So we got this.

Now this is the first step: it can count the lines. But it still have so many things to do. Here is something I can think of:

* should use processes to do concurrent
* maybe we can benchmark about this and others
* public to hex.pm and can build cmd which can be used in shell.

## Others

Thanks to *Programming Elixir*, I learned a lot from it.

This is a gift to Xuxiao, hoping it's qualified.
